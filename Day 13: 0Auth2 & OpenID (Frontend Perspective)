💡 Think of a nightclub analogy

OAuth2 (Authorization)
Imagine you want to go inside a nightclub, but instead of giving your real ID card to every staff member, you go to the front desk. The desk checks your real ID once, and then gives you a wristband.

That wristband is your access token.

It doesn’t show all your personal details — it just tells the guards: “Yes, this person has permission to be inside.”

Now, every time you go to the bar or the dance floor, you just flash the wristband, and they let you in. You’re not handing over your ID again and again.

👉 That’s OAuth2: It doesn’t prove who you are, it just proves you’re allowed to do something.

OpenID Connect (Authentication)
Now let’s say the club not only wants to know if you’re allowed inside, but also who you are. Are you Priya? Are you 25 years old? Do you have a VIP tag?

For this, the front desk gives you another badge along with the wristband.

This badge has your photo, your name, and maybe a few details like VIP status.

Now when you meet people inside the club, they can actually identify who you are, not just that you’re allowed inside.

👉 That’s OpenID Connect: It sits on top of OAuth2 and adds identity information about the user.

How this looks in Frontend

When you click “Login with Google”, your app sends you to Google (the nightclub front desk).

Google checks your ID (username + password).

If you’re valid, Google gives your app two things:

a wristband (OAuth2 access token) → lets your app fetch your emails, calendar, etc.

a badge (OpenID ID token) → tells your app who you are (name, email, profile).

Your app then uses these tokens without ever needing your actual Google password again.

✅ So in short, if I were explaining in an interview:
"OAuth2 is like getting a wristband in a club — it shows you’re allowed to do certain things but doesn’t say who you are. OpenID Connect is like also getting a badge with your identity details. On the frontend, OAuth2 is mainly about accessing APIs on behalf of the user, while OpenID is about knowing who the user is when they log in."

Do you want me to now give you a real-world frontend example (like what exactly happens when you click “Login with Google” in a React app), step by step?
