REST means Representational State Transfer. It is a way of designing APIs that communicate over HTTP.

In REST, everything is treated as a resource. A resource can be a user, a product, an order, etc. Each resource has a unique URL. For example:

/users ‚Üí all users

/users/5 ‚Üí user with ID 5

We use standard HTTP methods to work with these resources:

GET ‚Üí to read data

POST ‚Üí to create new data

PUT/PATCH ‚Üí to update existing data

DELETE ‚Üí to remove data

REST is stateless. This means the server doesn‚Äôt remember past requests. Every request from the client must have all the information needed (like login token, data, IDs). Because of this, REST APIs are easy to scale across multiple servers.

Responses are usually in JSON format, because it‚Äôs simple and widely used. Along with data, REST uses status codes to tell what happened:

200 OK ‚Üí success

201 Created ‚Üí new resource created

400 Bad Request ‚Üí wrong input

401 Unauthorized ‚Üí need to log in

500 Internal Server Error ‚Üí something went wrong on server

Good REST design also means using clear naming. Example: /products (plural) not /product. If there are relationships, use nested paths, like /users/5/orders.

Another best practice is versioning. Since APIs change, you put version numbers in the URL like /api/v1/users. This way old apps don‚Äôt break if the API changes.

For security, REST APIs always use HTTPS. Authentication methods like OAuth, JWT, or API keys are used. You also validate input and use rate limiting to avoid misuse.

So overall:
A REST API is a way to expose resources with URLs, use standard HTTP methods for actions, keep requests stateless, return JSON with proper status codes, stay consistent in naming, support versioning, and ensure security.

üëâ Now if you‚Äôre in an interview and asked, you can answer in this simple way:

‚ÄúA REST API is an architectural style where resources like users or products are exposed through URLs, and we use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to work with them. It‚Äôs stateless, meaning each request carries all required information. APIs usually return JSON responses along with standard status codes like 200, 201, or 400. Good practices include using consistent endpoint names, versioning the API for changes, and ensuring security through HTTPS and authentication. This makes REST APIs easy to use, predictable, and scalable.‚Äù
