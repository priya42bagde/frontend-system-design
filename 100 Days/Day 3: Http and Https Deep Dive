HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. It’s the foundation of communication on the web. In simple terms, it’s the set of rules that define how clients (like browsers) and servers talk to each other. Whenever we open a website, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, and the server responds with resources like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or data in JSON format.

HTTP is stateless, meaning each request is independent. The server doesn’t remember past requests unless we add something like cookies, tokens, or sessions to track the state.

Now, HTTPS is simply HTTP with security. The 'S' stands for Secure. It uses TLS/SSL encryption (Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer) to make sure three things happen:

Encryption – The data transferred between client and server is scrambled, so no one in the middle (like a hacker or ISP) can read it.

Authentication – The server proves its identity using a digital certificate issued by a trusted authority, so the client knows it’s talking to the real server.

Integrity – It ensures that the data hasn’t been tampered with during transfer.

For example, if I log in to my bank account over HTTP, my username and password would travel as plain text, which is risky. But with HTTPS, they’re encrypted, so even if someone intercepts the traffic, they can’t read it.

In terms of protocols, HTTP usually runs on port 80, while HTTPS runs on port 443.

Today, HTTPS is considered the default. In fact, most browsers mark HTTP-only sites as ‘Not Secure’.

So, to summarize: HTTP defines how the web communicates, and HTTPS adds a security layer on top using TLS/SSL, ensuring safe, trusted, and encrypted communication."



Now, whenever a client makes an HTTP/HTTPS request, the server responds not only with data (like HTML, CSS, or JSON) but also with an HTTP status code. These status codes are three-digit numbers that tell the client what happened with the request.

They are grouped into categories:

1xx – Informational Codes

Example: 100 Continue – The server acknowledges the request headers, and the client can continue sending the body.

2xx – Success Codes

200 OK – The request succeeded, and the response body contains the result.

201 Created – A new resource was successfully created, often in POST requests.

3xx – Redirection Codes

301 Moved Permanently – The resource is permanently at a new URL.

302 Found – Temporary redirect.

304 Not Modified – The cached version can be used; no need to re-download.

4xx – Client Error Codes

400 Bad Request – The request was invalid or malformed.

401 Unauthorized – Authentication is required.

403 Forbidden – The server understood the request but refuses to fulfill it.

404 Not Found – The requested resource doesn’t exist.

5xx – Server Error Codes

500 Internal Server Error – Something went wrong on the server.

502 Bad Gateway – The server received an invalid response from another server.

503 Service Unavailable – The server is down or overloaded.
