API rate limiting and throttling are mechanisms used to control how often clients can call an API. Rate limiting sets a hard cap, like 100 requests per minute, and if you exceed it you’ll get errors. Throttling, on the other hand, doesn’t block you completely but slows down or spaces out the extra requests. From a frontend point of view, this means we need to be smart about how we make calls—for example, using debouncing for search inputs, caching repeated results, or handling errors gracefully when a limit is hit. It’s important because if we don’t design carefully, the user experience can suffer, like delayed responses or failed requests.
