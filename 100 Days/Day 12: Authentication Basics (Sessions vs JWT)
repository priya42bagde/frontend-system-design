Authentication is basically about proving who the user is when they log into an application. There are two common ways to handle it on the web: sessions and JWTs. With sessions, once a user logs in, the server creates a session record and stores it in memory or a database. The server then gives the browser a session ID, usually stored in a cookie. Every time the browser makes a request, it sends that session ID, and the server looks it up to know which user it belongs to. The main thing here is that the server has to keep track of sessions, which can become heavy when you scale to many users. Now, with JWTs — JSON Web Tokens — the approach is different. Instead of storing the session on the server, the server gives the client a signed token after login. This token itself contains the user’s identity and maybe some permissions. The client sends this token with every request, and the server just verifies the signature. That means the server doesn’t have to store session data, which makes it easier to scale across multiple servers. From a frontend perspective, the impact is important. With sessions, cookies handle most of the work automatically, but they need proper handling for things like CSRF. With JWTs, we usually store the token in localStorage or cookies, and then attach it to API requests, but we also need to be careful about security, like XSS attacks. So, in short, sessions are more traditional and stateful — the server remembers you — while JWTs are stateless and portable — the client carries the proof. Both work for authentication, but which one to use often depends on the scale and architecture of the system.”
