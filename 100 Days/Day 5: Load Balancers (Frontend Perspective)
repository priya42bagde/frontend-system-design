Load Balancer is like a smart traffic manager that sits between the user’s browser and the backend servers.

It distributes incoming requests across multiple servers so no single server is overloaded. This helps in three main ways:

Performance – users get faster responses because traffic is spread out.

Reliability – if one server goes down, traffic is rerouted to others, so the website still works.

Scalability – as traffic grows, more servers can be added without changing anything on the frontend.

For example, when I visit Amazon, my request goes to a load balancer, which forwards it to the healthiest or least busy server. I don’t see this process, but I experience a fast and uninterrupted website.

So, in short, a load balancer ensures that from the user’s point of view, the app is always fast, available, and smooth."
