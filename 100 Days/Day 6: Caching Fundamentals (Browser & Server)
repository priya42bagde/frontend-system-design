aching is storing a copy of data in a temporary location so future requests can be served faster without re-fetching everything from the original source.

From a browser perspective, caching means storing static assets like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or images on the userâ€™s device. For example, when I open a site the first time, the browser downloads all these files. On my next visit, instead of asking the server again, it loads them from the local cache, which makes the page load much faster. Browser caching is controlled through HTTP headers like Cache-Control and Expires.

From a server perspective, caching is about reducing load on backend systems. The server may use in-memory caches like Redis or Memcached to quickly serve frequently requested data â€” for example, the top 10 trending products. Instead of querying the database every time, the server can return the result directly from the cache, which is much faster.

So, in short: browser caching improves speed for end users, while server caching improves scalability and reduces backend workload. Together, they make applications both faster and more efficient."

Caching in the frontend is basically about storing data so that we donâ€™t have to fetch or compute it again and again. In JavaScript or React, we can achieve caching in multiple ways depending on what we want to cache.

1. Browser Storage Caching

For example, if I fetch some user details from an API, instead of hitting the API every time, I can store it in localStorage or sessionStorage.

localStorage is permanent until we clear it.

sessionStorage lasts only for that browser tab session.

// Example: caching API response
function fetchUserData() {
  const cached = localStorage.getItem("userData");
  if (cached) {
    return Promise.resolve(JSON.parse(cached));
  }

  return fetch("/api/user")
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      localStorage.setItem("userData", JSON.stringify(data));
      return data;
    });
}


This way, the next time I need user data, I just read from localStorage instead of hitting the API.

2. In-Memory Caching (React State / Context)

If the data is needed only while the app is open, I can cache it in memory using React state, context, or even a global store like Redux.

const [userData, setUserData] = useState(null);

useEffect(() => {
  if (!userData) {
    fetch("/api/user")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setUserData(data));
  }
}, [userData]);


Here, once I fetch the data, I donâ€™t re-fetch it again within the session unless needed.

3. Service Workers (Offline Caching)

For more advanced caching, especially for offline-first apps, I can use service workers.
Service workers can intercept network requests and serve cached responses from the browserâ€™s Cache API.

// service-worker.js
self.addEventListener("fetch", event => {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then(cachedResponse => {
      return cachedResponse || fetch(event.request);
    })
  );
});


This way, if Iâ€™m offline or the server is slow, the cached version is served instantly.

4. Library-based Caching (React Query / SWR)

In real-world apps, I usually donâ€™t reinvent the wheel. Libraries like React Query or SWR automatically cache API calls in memory and even revalidate them in the background.

import { useQuery } from "react-query";

function User() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useQuery("user", () =>
    fetch("/api/user").then(res => res.json())
  );

  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  return <div>{data.name}</div>;
}


This way, when I revisit the component, it doesnâ€™t re-fetch immediately. It serves cached data first and updates in the background if needed.

ðŸ‘‰ You (wrapping up):
So, in frontend caching, the main techniques are:

localStorage/sessionStorage â†’ for persistence

in-memory state â†’ for temporary caching

service workers â†’ for offline caching

React Query / SWR â†’ for smart caching with revalidation

This makes apps faster, reduce network calls, and give a better user experience.
